### *Summary:*
Last two years _I am working as a Business analyst_ in a product company.
The IT sector attracts me with its dynamic and self-realization capabilities.
During the process of working as an analyst, _I learned more and more about the field of software development._
I read articles and pass online courses, as a result I realized that I find _web development_ to be the most interesting for myself.
Having gained experience, I am planing to develop in the direction of smart home systems.
